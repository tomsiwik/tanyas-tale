# Tanya's Tale Refactoring Log

This is a living document tracking our refactoring progress using TDD and SOLID principles.
Each task should be implemented with failing tests first, then implementation, and feature flags for safe rollback.

## Core Architecture

### Components

- [x] Base Component System

  - [x] Abstract Component class
  - [x] Entity component management
  - [x] Feature flag system

- [x] Position Component

  - [x] Basic position state
  - [x] Get/Set position
  - [x] Feature flag integration
  - [x] Legacy compatibility

- [x] Movement Component

  - [x] Velocity handling
  - [x] Position updates
  - [x] Feature flag integration
  - [x] Legacy compatibility

- [ ] Animation Component

  - [ ] Sprite state management
  - [ ] Animation frame updates
  - [ ] Direction-based animations
  - [ ] Integration with SpriteManager

- [ ] Health Component

  - [ ] Health state management
  - [ ] Damage/Heal methods
  - [ ] Death state handling
  - [ ] Health regeneration

- [ ] Skills Component

  - [ ] Skill cooldown management
  - [ ] Skill targeting
  - [ ] Skill effects
  - [ ] Skill animations

- [ ] Effects Component
  - [ ] Effect duration management
  - [ ] Effect stacking
  - [ ] Effect animations
  - [ ] Status effects

### Refactoring Tasks

- [ ] Extract common vector operations into Vector2D utility
- [ ] Create ComponentRegistry for type-safe component access
- [ ] Add component dependency resolution
- [ ] Implement component lifecycle hooks (init/destroy)
- [ ] Add component event system

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed components
- [ ] Add spatial partitioning for collision detection
- [ ] Optimize animation frame updates
- [ ] Add component update priority system

### Testing

- [ ] Add integration tests between components
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add stress tests for component system
- [ ] Add memory leak detection tests

## Notes

- Each component should be independently toggleable via feature flags
- All new features must have tests before implementation
- Keep backward compatibility until features are stable
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
